## Our mission
DNB employees are using ever more data in their work. The DSH aims to empower them, ranging from straightforward process automation to cutting edge machine learning applications. To accomplish this, the DSH strives to take away the hurdles that come with using open source tooling and tries to stimulate cross-project fertilisation.
